        <h1>Project On Console</h1>
        <p>The Visual Studio integrated development environment is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build code, and then publish an app. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a feature-rich program that can be used for many aspects of software development.</p>
    <p>The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.</p>
   <script> console.log("My first Console Project");
       var first_name="Samridhi";
       var last_name="Ravikumar";
       console.log(first_name.concat(last_name));
       var a = 17;
       var b = 2;

       var add = a+b;
       console.log(add);

       var sub = a-b;
       console.log(sub);

       var multiple = a*b;
       console.log(multiple);

       var divide = a/b;
       console.log(divide);
